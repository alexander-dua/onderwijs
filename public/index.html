		<h3 id="subtitle">An academic journal made for high school students, by high school students.</h3>
		
		<p id="homeText">High school students often read academic journals for school assignments, however, the stringent requirements of most academic journals prevent high school students from sharing their own work. Onderwijs aims to provide high school students with a platform to share their scholarly work with the world. Onderwijs is completely free to use, and no account is required to begin. While designed with high schoolers in mind, anyone, irrespective of age or education level, can submit or read work on Onderwijs.</p>
